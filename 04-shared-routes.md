# Module 04: Shared routes

### Goal
Use groups and group precedence to make the same route go to two different places, depending on how arrive there.

We'll enable navigating from the Home tab to an exhibit work without breaking navigation by sharing the exhibits stack screen between the Home and Exhibits tab. 

Then, we'll enable sharing of links to works of art to visitors who are not logged in by creating an alternate entry point for them outside of the logged-in protected routes that uses the same URL.

### Concepts
- Create distinct routes that share the same outward-facing URL, but use `(group)` syntax to differentiate their position in the heirarchy. 
  - Take advantage of alphabetic precedence to ensure your "dominant" route is used when you want it to be.
- Use groups to create links that behave differently depending on whether you're navigating to them from another route or you're using them as your initial entry point.
- Share the same screen with two different sibling routes with array (e.g., `(route1, route2)`) syntax

### Tasks
- Turn `/exhibits/[exhibit]` into a shared route that is a sibling of both the Home and Exhibits tabs, so it pushes onto either while staying within the same tab. However, if you share a link to an exhibit, it will always open the Exhibits tab.
- Create an alternate entry point into `works/[workId]` that lets anyone look at a work of art shared by a user, even if they're not logged in (Instagram-style)

# Exercises

## Exercise 1: Two stacks, one route: what hath the Home tab wrought?
Let's do some tiny, seemingly-inconsequential thing...that will set off a ripple effect throughout our code, snowballing into a pretty-involved refactor.

1. In the Home tab, wouldn't it be nifty if you could click on the exhibit name and it would take you to the exhibit? Let's do that. In **(app)/(tabs)/index.tsx**, you'll see that each square is implemented by an `Artwork` component. Head into **Artwork.tsx** and wrap the exhibit name in a `Link` and `Pressable`:

```diff
+<Link asChild href={`/exhibits/${exhibitName}`}>
+  <Pressable>
    <View className="flex-row items-center gap-x-2">
      <Text className="text-l uppercase font-bold tracking-widest">
        {exhibitName}
      </Text>
      <View className="flex-1 h-0.5 bg-shade-2" />
    </View>
+  </Pressable>
+ </Link>
```

üèÉ**Try it** Click on the link. You can go to exhibits, yay!

I don't know if I trust this thing, though. Let's put it through its paces. These scenarios work best in a browser, though you could test them in the mobile app using deep links. **Refresh the browser before each one to reset navigation history**:
- **(A)** Start on Home tab (don't go anywhere else) -> click on an exhibit -> go back
- **(B)** Go to Exhibits tab -> go back to Home tab -> click on an exhibit -> go back

These are both a little weird, right? 

For A), there's no back button! For B), there is a back button, but it takes you back to the Exhibits tab. But that's not "back" for where you were coming from.

A) is happening because you are navigating directly to the non-initial screen in the exhibits stack, and the initial screen never gets loaded prior to that. B) works around that to some extent by loading the initial screen by rendering the tab (which only happens when you navigate to it), but now you're deep in a stack, so back takes you out to the top of the exhibits stack instead of to the Home tab.

Let's fix this! Individual exhibits should always be children of the `exhibits` route, but back should take you back to where you were regardless of where you come from.

### Creating some space: tabs inside of groups
This is going to affect the `(tabs)/index` and `(tabs)/exhibits` routes, so lets add an extra layer to each of those so we have some space to define a shared stack layout and shared routes between the two. Since the "layer" will be route groups, they will not actually affect the URL's.

1. Create an **app/(app)/(tabs)/(home)** folder and put **(tabs)/index.tsx** inside it.
2. Create an **app(app)/(tabs)/(exhibits)** folder and put **(tabs)/exhibits** inside it (including everything inside that folder).
3. Update **app(app)/(tabs)/_layout.tsx** to account for the new home for the index route:
```diff
- <TabTrigger name="index" href="/" asChild>
+ <TabTrigger name="index" href="/(home)" asChild>
```

üèÉ**Try it** Move around between Home and exhibits. Some stuff is probably working, but it probably looks odd sometimes (extra headers on exhibits??) and doesn't really go to all the right places. In particular, going to an Exhibit from Home and then using the back header button looks off.

4. Let's start sharing route information by sharing a layout between `home` and `exhibits`. Move **(tabs)/(exhibits)/exhibits/_layout.tsx** to a new folder, **(tabs)/(home,exhibits)**. Then add a second stack screen to make sure we're hiding the header whenever we're at the `exhibits` index:
```tsx
<Stack.Screen
  name="exhibits/index"
  options={{
    headerShown: false,
  }}
/>
```

üèÉ**Try it** The array synxtax of the route shares this layout whether you're inside the `(home)` or `(exhibits)` group, meaning that `exhibits` should not show an extra unwanted header bar no matter how we enter it.

<!--TODO: this may not be a good lesson above because it may depend on what's underneath it. Need to test!-->

### Stacking up right: staying in your tab
At this point, navigating to an exhibit from the home tab should still be moving you over to the Exhibits tab. That's because `exhibits/[exhibitName]` is only under `(exhibits)`. We need it to be under both `(home)` and `(exhibits)` in order to stay within the tab where you entered the route from.

5. Move **(app)/(tabs)/(exhibits)/exhibits** (and all of its contents) to **(home,exhibits)**.

6. If you tried it just now, you might get an error about duplicate tab triggers, because `/exhibits` is now inside of `/(home)`. Update **app(app)/(tabs)/_layout.tsx** to account for the new home for the exhibits tab route:
```diff
- <TabTrigger name="exhibits" href="/exhibits" asChild>
+ <TabTrigger name="exhibits" href="/(exhibits)" asChild>
```

üèÉ**Try it** Entering an exhibit from either tab should keep you in that tab. That's because the `exhibits/[exhibitName]` is in _both tabs_, and Expo Router is picking the nearest matching route.

### Route precedence
Try going to an exhibit, copying the URL, and opening it in another tab. Which tab (in your layout) is selected? When navigating to the deep link fresh, it'd make more sense if it took you inside the Exhibits tab, since the Home tab is just random stuff and going "back" from there wouldn't make much sense. We have one form of precedence here- array syntax order! The first matching route will be the one that's first in the route group array.

6. Rename **(home,exhibits)** to **(exhibits,home)**

üèÉ**Try it** Entering an exhibit, copy the URL, and open it in a new browser tab. It should always be inside the Exhibits tab. But what about the back button?

### `initialRouteName`
We want a back button to show up whenever we deep link to an exhibit, and it should take you back to exhibits. Whenever you start at a deep link and don't see a back button, you should suspect it's related to setting `initialRouteName` somewhere.

7. In **(tabs)/(exhibits,home)/_layout.tsx**, update the `unstable_settings` to set the initial route to `exhibits/index` whenever you enter through the `(exhibits)` group (a mouthful!):
```tsx
export const unstable_settings = {
  initialRouteName: "index",
  exhibits: {
    initialRouteName: "exhibits/index",
  },
};
```

üèÉ**Try it** Things should be looking pretty good by now, whether you're navigating around or deep-linking to an exhibit.

> [!TIP]
> the `exhibits` key in `unstable_settings` refers to the `(group)`, while the `initialRouteName` inside that key refers to the actual route. This is a little confusing, which is why this is considered "unstable" (we're looking into better ways to express complex relationships like these).

### Wait a minute! A mini-routing challenge

You might be noticing something fishy about this solution. There's an empty **(exhibits)** folder, but everything _seems_ to work. At some level, that makes sense, because Exhibits are shared between Home and Exhibits, with Home having the unique Home screen...right?

All _legal_ routes work, but how about illegal routes. Can you break this layout? See if you can figure out what's wrong before using the hint and answer below.

  Try going directly to `localhost:8081/(home)/exibits`
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Expand to see the answer</summary>
  
  We got a little greedy when copying over all of the contents of **exhibits** to the shared route. `exhibits/index` (the list of all exhibits) is _not_ shared with the Home tab. Move **exhibits/index.tsx** to **(exhibits)**.

  Maybe it's not likely someone would attempt to access this route, but it's good to know that route groups can be specifically navigated to, even though they are not considered part of the URL. This is why they can be used in links, redirects, etc.

  BUT...notice anything else funny? Try navigating to the Exhibits tab and look at the URL.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Expand to see the even better answer! (but check the first answer first)</summary>
  
  The first answer worked because our `TabTrigger` in **(tabs)/_layout.tsx** was pointing to `(exhibits)`, but that doesn't change the URL, which means you can't deep link to the Exhibits tab anymore.

  How to fix that:
  1. Move **(exhibits)/index.tsx** to **(exhibits)/exhibits/index.tsx** (this makes `/exhibits` a real route again).
  2. Update the Exhibits `TabTrigger` in **(tabs)/_layout.tsx** so `href` is equal to `(exhibits)/exhibits`.

  Even though this was quite a roundabout way to get to the correct routes, what's notable is that when you consider just the non-group routes (e.g., stuff that should appear in the URL), everything lines up: we have an `/exhibits`, `/exhibits/[exhibitName]` under `(home)`, and an `/exhibits/[exhibitName]` under `(exhibits)`.
</details>

## Exercise 2: Instagram-style "public post" page
We want there to basically be two ways to access `/works/[workId]`:
1. When you're logged in and browsing, as a modal on top of the tab layout.
2. When you're receiving a direct link, as its own separate fullscreen layout.

This is where _route groups_ can help. They let us define what is in essance the same URL (as far as the user is concerned) in multiple places:
- `app/(app)/works/[workId]` has an outward-facing URL of `/works/[workId]`
- `app/(otherway)/works/[workId]` _also_ has an outward-facing URL of `/works/[workId]`

There's a few different ways you could navigate to each distinct route:
- In your URL bar of application code, address it specifically, including the groups (e.g., `app/(otherway)/works/[workId]`)
- Depending on where you are in the navigation tree already, if you just use the outward-facing URL (e.g., `works/[workId]`), you'll go to whichever route is closest.

### Works page doppleganger
Let's start by just duplicating the route component somewhere else and navigating there.

1. Create the **app/(direct)** folder (we'll call it this because our goal is to go _directly_ there with a deep link)
2. Inside of **app/(direct)**, create the **works** folder, and then inside of that, **[workId].tsx**. So, the whole route will be `app/(direct)/works/[workId]` (under `direct`, the route is the same as or original route - it's _shared_).
3. Import the screen component you already have into this new **[workId].tsx** file:
```tsx
import WorkIdScreen from "@/app/(app)/works/[workId]";

export default WorkIdScreen;
```

üèÉ**Try it** In your browser, start at the initial route, open a work. Now, add `(direct)` in front of the works route, e.g., `http://localhost:8081/(direct)/works/137259`. Does it look a little different, like there's a modal with nothing behind it?

Now try the scenario we've been talking about this whole time, where you share the link to a work of art with someone else. Go back through the entry point, open a work of art, copy the URL and open it in another tab. Does it go to the `(direct)` version or the original?

### Route precedence
When Expo Router is resolving a url, and two routes match that url, it has to have rules in order to pick one. Of course it needs to match what's actually in the URL (e.g., whatever it picks needs to have `works` and `[workId]` in that order, though groups don't count against the matching and could be in-between those).

In the future, other resolution methods may be available, but currently, Expo Router uses alphabetical order to break ties between route groups.

`/works/[workId]` matches both:
- `(app)/works/[workId]`, and
- `(direct)/works/[workId]`

But `(app)` is before `(direct)` in the alphabet, so `(app)` wins. Let's fix that by renaming `(direct)`

4. Rename the **(direct)** folder to **(1-direct)**.

üèÉ**Try it** In your browser, start at the initial route, open a work. Now copy that URL and open it in a new tab. Hopefully it goes to the `(direct)` version now.

> [!NOTE]
> So, why does it go to the `(app)` version still if I start from the initial route? That's because Expo Router will look for the _nearest-matching_ route before it goes back through the top and looks at alphabetical order. So, order is important, but proximity > order.

### Cleaning things up
Let's make this new direct link look like something intentional and not just a broken modal.

5. Refactor everything inside of the `ScrollView` (including the `ScrollView` itself) in **app/(app)/works/[workId].tsx** into a separate `ArtworkDetail` component that you can put inside a new **components/ArtworkDetail.tsx** file. The component will need to take at least one parameter, the `work` object that's returned from the `useWorkByIdQuery()` hook (feel free to do as Keith does and use the `any` type, he won't mind!).

## Exercise 1b: Of `initialRouteName`'s and `Redirect`'s

I take it back - we're going to fix the logged-in behavior of what we just did to _really_ match Instagram, which either shows you the post-only view when you're logged out, or takes you right into the post as if you're logged in, with you feed underneath.

It really, really helps to understand something important about `initialRouteName` at this point: _it only applies to when you first load up the app/website_. It's simply a mechanism to ensure that a deep link into the app pushes whatever routes need to be underneath the deep link's screen onto the history.

However, in this example, a redirect to the same deep link after the app has already been loaded would be helpful. Fortunately, there's now a way to apply `initialRouteName` config to in-app navigation: the `withAnchor` prop.

1. Let's try the redirect first without `withAnchor`. In **app/(1-direct)/works/[workId].tsx** add this after all the hooks, but before the return statement:
```tsx
 if (authToken) {
  return <Redirect href={`/(app)/works/${workId}`} />;
}
```

Don't forget to `import { Redirect } from "expo-router";`

üèÉ**Try it** If you're logged in, now reloading the page on a work will take you to the same place you were, but... you can't go anywhere else. No back button, no tabs. 

Recall earlier that, before you added the `(1-direct)` route, that a direct link would open up the tabs screen underneath the works screen and there would be a back button so you could get back to that. That was `initialRouteName` in action. Expo Router can't assume that you always want a particular screen opened first when navigating somewhere (how would it know your intentions), so now there's a parameter to tell Router to respect `initialRouteName` on a particular navigation operation if the route has not already been loaded.

2. Add `withAnchor`:

```diff
 if (authToken) {
-  return <Redirect href={`/(app)/works/${id}`} />;
+  return <Redirect href={`/(app)/works/${id}`} withAnchor />;
}
```

3. Oh wait, see those red squiggles? This API isn't _quite_ available yet ([so close!](https://github.com/expo/expo/pull/32847)). I expect you'll be able to use the `Redirect` component soon for this. For now you can do it like this, it's about the same. Maybe you lose 1 tick in performance:

```tsx
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    if (authToken) {
      router.replace(`/(app)/works/${workId}`, { withAnchor: true });
    }
  }, [authToken, router, workId]);
```
(import `useRouter` from `expo-router`)

üèÉ**Try it** If you're logged in, now reloading the page on a work will take you to the same place you were, and everything works as before!
